   <h1>Koshary</h1>
   <img src="Pics/Koshary.jpg" height="310">
   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>it is widely considered Egypt's national dish. Rice, lentils (black or brown), chickpeas and pasta are cooked individually,
     then tossed together and topped with cumin-scented tomato sauce and crunchy fried onions.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Use Egyptian rice (also known as Calrose short-grain rice).</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Lentils: </strong> I recommend using brown lentils for the right koshari experience; however, green lentils can be substituted.</li>
        <li><strong>Onions:</strong>You can use white onion, brown onion, yellow onion, sweet onion, or red onion.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the chickpeas with cumin while preparing the fried onions.</li>
        <li>Chop the onions into thin circles. Allow the onions tossed in flour to rest for 30 minutes prior to frying.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked brown lentils and water to the cooked onions. Bring to a boil for 10 minutes, or until the lentils are soft.</li>
    </ol>
