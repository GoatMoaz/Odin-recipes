   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>A smash burger is a <strong>burger</strong> that is made by smashing the ground beef onto the grill or griddle with a spatula. 
    Smashing the burger results in a sear on the outside of the meat, which locks in all of the juices and flavor.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground Beef:</strong> We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty burgers,
         but you can easily scale the recipe up to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty burgers).</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce: </strong> A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what we use to grill and assemble the burgers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong>we love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers, but you can use American-style cheese or your favorite sliced cheese.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Patties:</strong>Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Sauce: </strong>Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep Toppings :</strong>fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast buns:</strong>lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</li>
    </ol>
